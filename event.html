                <h3>What is Youth Oppression?</h3>
                <p>Youth Oppression is the fact that society considers the youger population to be incapable of doing certain task such as: protect themselves, make choice form themselves, and have their own opinions, but what makes ageism worst is that the people who are being oppressed can not fight back because their opinions will not be listened to; their protest will be valued as "kids being kids," and most of all they can easily be silenced with a simple "shut up" from their parents. In this world, our youth is told that they have no power and influence by our government and their parent, but we can change it to not only benefit our futures, since they are the future, but to benefit their future by making a much more united world.</p>

                <h3>How can We Solve it?</h3>
                <p id="half">We can solve youth oppression by simple not telling our what to do but instead guide to make there own choice and form the own opinions. Yes, we still need to teach them the basic right and wrongs like to respect others, be honest, and have an open mind, but we need to guide them to expand on those right and wrongs, like being conservative or liberal. And as parents, we need to challenge those opinions and let them challenge ours, so both us and our child can learn and grow. If we teach our child these problem we can stop the world form arguing against themselves and we can united the world to solve greater problems. This is why at Age is Just a Number, we speak about Ageism because if we teach and empower our childern, we can change the world.</p>
